The future of web based user interactions is now.


## Why we made Hand Terminal?
---
Hand Terminal adds a new layer of user experience while watching videos on the web. You can control your video experience by just a motion of your hand in front
of your web camera. No more getting the keyboard dirty because you were having a pizza üçï  while watching youtube ;)
